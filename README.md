In this assignment we were asked to create a DAPP for students gymkhana elections.

In it I have also made a frontend website for registering and casting the vote.

In it when we click the Connect to metamask then it gives pop up for connecting with metamask and our metamask will be connected.

here we will cast our vote to each candidate as per our preference and then click on submit so our contract will be deployed and scores will be updated.
